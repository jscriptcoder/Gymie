## Installation

Gymie-Client is available as a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gymie), and can installed as a dependency as usual:

```bash
$ npm install gymie
```

You can also clone the repo and npm-link the library as follows, although there isn't really a good readon to do it this way, unless you wanna contribute to the library and test it locally.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jscriptcoder/Gymie-Client
Cloning into 'Gymie-Client'...
...

$ cd Gymie-Client/
$ npm link
gymie@0.x.y preinstall /path/to/Gymie-Client
...

$ cd ~/path/to/project
$ npm link gymie
/path/to/project/node_modules/gymie -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/gymie -> /path/to/Gymie-Client
```

During the installation [Gymie-Server](https://pypi.org/project/gymie/) will also be installed. It's important to note that Gymie-Server requires Python>=3.6, so I suggest to conda-create an environment with such version if it's not already installed... or upgrade Python to at least this version.

## How to run the client (and server)

Gymie-Client communicates with a server through WebSockets. This server will provide Gymie with an API to access the underlying gym-like API to create and interact with an environment.
